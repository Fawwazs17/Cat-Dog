# Cat vs Dog Classification Project

A machine learning model for classifying images of cats and dogs, developed in Jupyter Notebook and Google Colab.

## Features
- Image classification using convolutional neural networks
- Data augmentation for improved generalization
- Model export to TensorFlow SavedModel format
- Performance metrics visualization

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Jupyter Notebook

## Usage
1. Open `ML2TF.ipynb` in Google Colab
2. Run all cells to train the model
3. Export trained model using `tf.saved_model.save()`
